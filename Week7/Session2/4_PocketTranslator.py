# Flow:
#   1. Listen to the user speak in English (microphone)
#   2. Translate the speech using TranslationRecognizer
#   3. Synthesize the translated text in the target language
#      and play it through the speakers
#
# The TranslationRecognizer does steps 1 + 2 in a single call —
# it recognises and translates simultaneously. A separate
# SpeechSynthesizer is then used for step 3 for the target language conversion.
